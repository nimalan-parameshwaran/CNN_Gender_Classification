# CNN_Gender_Classification

# Overview

The CNN Gender Classification project is a deep learning-based solution for classifying the gender of individuals from facial images. This project is designed for researchers, developers, and data scientists who are interested in building and deploying gender classification systems using **Convolutional Neural Networks**.

# Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to train a CNN model to automatically classify the gender (male or female) of a person based on their facial features. Gender classification has various real-world applications, including demographic analysis, personalized user experiences, and content recommendation systems. By using deep learning techniques, we can automate this task with high accuracy.
